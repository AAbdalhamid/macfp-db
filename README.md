Measurement and Computation of Fire Phenomena Database

Welcome to the MaCFP database!

The central objective of the MaCFP working group is to target fundamental progress in fire science and to advance predictive fire modeling.  The purpose of this database is to host high-quality experimental data for the purpose of validating physics-based fire models.  The working group meets before the [IAFSS](http://www.iafss.org/) conference currently held every three years.

Experimentalists and modelers may participate in the group by submitting pull requests to this repository or by sending data via email to [Randy McDermott](mailto:randall.mcdermott@nist.gov).
