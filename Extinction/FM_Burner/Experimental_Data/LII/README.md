## Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) Experimental Data Files

#### fvmean.csv
* This file contains the mean soot volume fraction distribution in normal air condition.
* The data were measured at 0.5D, 1.0D, 1.5D, 2.5D, and 3.5D heights, where D is the burner diameter (15.2 cm).
* Each column lists the soot volume fraction (unit: parts-per-million, ppm) at different distance from flame centerline for one height.

#### fvrms.csv
* This file contains the RMS of soot volume fraction fluctuation in normal air condition.
* The data were measured at 0.5D, 1.0D, 1.5D, 2.5D, and 3.5D heights, where D is the burner diameter (15.2 cm).
* Each column lists the RMS of soot volume fraction fluctuation (unit: parts-per-million, ppm) at different distance from flame centerline for one height.

#### Local_fvpdf_0.5D_20.9OI.csv
* This file contains the probability density function of soot volume fraction in normal air condition at 0.5D height, where D is the burner diameter (15.2 cm).
* The data were measured at different locations away from the centerline (0 cm, 1 cm, …until 16 cm), with a 1 cm×1 cm area for PDF statistical analysis.
* The first two columns list the edges and center of bins (unit: ppm).
* From the third column, each column lists the PDF for certain soot volume fraction for one location.

#### Local_fvpdf_1.0D_20.9OI.csv
