## FM Burner Experimental Setup

The burner design and boundary conditions are described below. Figure 1 shows the burner geometry. The burner has an inner diameter of 13.7 cm (5.4 in.) and an outer diameter of 15.2 cm (6 in.). The burner wall has a thickness of 0.3 in. and is water cooled to be approximately 25 ยบC. The upper edge is shaped to be 45ยบ slanted. The burner surface is filled with steel beads, see Figure 2, that are cooled by a cooling water coils placed inside steel beads.

Figure 3 shows the enclosure drawing. The enclosure has a cross section of 122 by 122 cm2 (4 by 4 ft2). The lower section is a plenum space and a sand bed for distributing the oxidant. The burner placed on a translation stage sits above the sand bed, with the bottom surface of burner approximately 11.4 cm (4.5 in.) away from the bed surface. The burner centerline is aligned with the exhaust hood at the start of a test, and could traverse laterally in an optical based experiment, e.g. laser induced incandescence measurements. The distance between the burner surface and hood lower edge is approximately 81 cm (32 in.). The hood has an outer diameter of 61 cm (24 in.). The exhaust flow rate is maintained at approximately 0.11 m^3/s. At this condition, the oxygen concentrations around the flame at various heights was verified to be the same as prescribed.

The flame examined in this study has a theoretical heat release rate of 15 kW. Three oxygen indexes are investigated, including normal air, 16.8% oxygen in nitrogen, and 15.2% oxygen in nitrogen. The fuel, air, and nitrogen flow rates corresponding to each OI condition are listed in Table 1.

#### Notes

The temperature was measured using a two-thermocouple probe, and the reported data is corrected. This technique is mainly applied to correct the thermal inertia as the radiation correction for a small thermocouple junction is insignificant. The two thermocouples have nominal size 25 and 50 microns.
