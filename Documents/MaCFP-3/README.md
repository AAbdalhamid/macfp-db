# MaCFP-3 Workshop Documents and Reports

The LaTeX file 'Guidelines_for_Participation_MaCFP3.tex' can be used to create the 'Guidelines for Participation in the MaCFP-3 Workshop' document. To compile this document, you must have up-to-date versions of both the macfp-db and matl-db repositories; both repositories must be located in the same parent folder (e.g., ../MACFP/macfp-db and ../MACFP/matl-db).
