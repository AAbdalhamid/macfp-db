## FM vertical wall fire data

The experimental data are summarized in the following .csv files, which include soot depth at different elevation locations and fuel flow rates for propylene, uncorrected and corrected temperature profiles at Z = 771 mm with different fuel flow rates for propylene, flame outward radiance at different elevation locations and fuel flow rates for propylene, and total heat flux at different fuel flow rates for methane, ethane, ethylene and propylene. Those data have been published in Refs. 1 and 2. 

Detailed description of the .csv files are
