## Sandia Flames Experimental Data

The data in this directory is organized into files by test series and height, z, above the fire source; p3 indicates z = 0.301 m, p5 indicates z = 0.502 m, and p9 indicates z = 0.903 m above the source.

Data is presented in columns as follows:

| x (m) | U mean (m/s) | W mean (m/s) | TKE (m2/s2) |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |

x (m) is the radial coordinate.

U mean (m/s) is the mean radial velocity component.

W mean (m/s) is the mean vertical velocity component.

TKE (m2/s2) is the turbulent kinetic energy (only available for Tests 24 and 35).
