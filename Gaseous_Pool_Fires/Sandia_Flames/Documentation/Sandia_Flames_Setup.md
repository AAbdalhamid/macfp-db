Figure 1: Schematic of PIV setup in FLAME facility. The excimer laser light sheet bisects the plume inlet surface. Two 35-mm motion cameras, one recording the ultraviolet image for PIV, the other the visible image, view the fire through a mirror. Seed particle injectors are located in the methane and in the surrounding air.
