(a) Commercial grade, 95% purity.

(b) Fuel inlet spatial uniformity is ±6% of inlet velocity in all cases [Blanchat, 2001].

(c) Quadrant to quadrant spatial variability ±10% or less, small features ±37% [Blanchat, 2001]; puffing-induced temporal fluctuation 4% or less for all cases.

(d) Spatially varying, cooler at the base, hotter at the top; see [Tieszen et al., 2002] for geometry.

(e) Spatially varying, cooler just above the shield wall, hotter near the ceiling; see [Tieszen et al., 2002] for geometry.

(f) Spatially varying, cooler near the facility wall, hotter near the chimney entrance; see [Tieszen et al., 2002] for geometry.
