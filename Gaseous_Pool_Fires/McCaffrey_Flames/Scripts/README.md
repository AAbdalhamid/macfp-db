To generate plots, run the Matlab script within this directory.  From a terminal with Matlab open simply type
```
>> plot_McCaffrey_Correlation % creates plots of correlation and data
>> plot_McCaffrey_Flames      % creates plots of correlation and submitted computational results
```
The plots are created and put in the McCaffrey_Flames/Plots/ directory.
