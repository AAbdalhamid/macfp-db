## This is a test of using Markdown and Jupyter Notebook

Now I will add some other text that probably is of no interest whatsoever.  But we just want to see what this looks like.  Sort of a Lorem Ipsum thing... probably spelled that incorrectly.  At some point someone will expect a plot of some kind.


```python
import matplotlib
```


```python
import numpy as np
```


```python
x = np.array([0,1,2,3])
```


```python
print(x)
```

    [0 1 2 3]



```python
y=x.copy()
```


```python
print(y)
```

    [0 1 2 3]



```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
plt.plot(x,y)
```
