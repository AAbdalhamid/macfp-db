To generate plots, [run the Python script](https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/wiki/Plotting-Scripts) within this directory.  From an iPython terminal type:
```
In [1]: run Sandia_Helium_Plume_plot_exp.py
```
Or, from a terminal command line:
```
$ python3 Sandia_Helium_Plume_plot_exp.py
```

The plots are created and put in the Sandia_Helium_Plume/Plots/ directory.

Deprecated:

The Matlab script, `plot_Sandia_Helium_Plume.m`, was used to plot data for MaCFP-1 (2017).
