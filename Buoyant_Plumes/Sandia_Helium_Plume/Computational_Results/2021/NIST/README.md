Wall clock time: see table above

Simulation time: see table above

Number of CPUs (MPI Processes): see table above

CPU cost (Number of CPUs * Wall clock time / Simulation time / Total cells): see table above

Comments: Load imbalance increased as the resolution increased because the same mesh arrangement was kept the same while increasing resolution of the central core meshes around the plume.  This mesh arrangement is not useful for assessing scalability.
