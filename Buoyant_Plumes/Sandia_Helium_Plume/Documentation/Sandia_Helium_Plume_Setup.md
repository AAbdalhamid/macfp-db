##Sandia Helium Plume Setup

####Introduction

The Fire Laboratory for Accreditation of Models by Experimentation (FLAME) facility [Blanchat, 2001; O'Hern et al., 2005] at San- dia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is designed specifically for validating models of buoyant fire plumes. The plume source is 1 m in diameter surrounded by a 0.5 m steel "ground plane". Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) techniques were used to obtain instantaneous joint scalar and velocity fields.
