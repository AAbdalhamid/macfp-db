## NIST Pool Fires

This directory contains experimental measurements of liquid and gaseous pool fires. Results using two circular, liquid pool burners are reported, 30 cm and 100 cm in diameter. Results using a 37 cm diameter, water-cooled, gaseous burner are also reported.  Experimental results are reported for steadily burning fires in a well-ventilated, quiescent environment. A warm-up period of 10 min was required for the mass burning rate of the liquid fuels to be steady.

### Notes:

#### Burners, Coordinate System and Lip Height
* Kim et al (2019) report that the NIST burner has an inner diameter of 30.1 cm, a wall thickness of 0.13 cm, and a depth of 15 cm. The burner is fitted with legs such that the burner rim is positioned 30 cm above the floor. The bottom of the burner is maintained at a constant temperature by flowing tap water (nominally 20 °C) through a 3 cm section on the bottom of the fuel pan.

* Weckman and Strong (1996) report using a "30.5 cm diameter" burner.  Personal communication with Weckman (2020) clarifies that the _outer_ diameter of the burner is 30.5 cm, the wall thickness is 0.15 cm, and the depth is 6.0 cm.

* The lip height (distance from the top of the burner rim to the fuel surface) varies from study to study. For 30 cm diameter methanol pool fires, Weckman and Strong (1996) and Kim et al. (2019) report a lip height of 10 mm, whereas Hamins et al. (1994), Klassen et al. (1994), and Hamins and Lock (2016) report a lip height of 5 mm.

* For 30 cm diameter ethanol and acetone pool fires, Kim et al. (2019) report a lip height of 10 mm.

* The 37 cm gaseous burner (zero lip height) is water-cooled and maintains a nearly ambient temperature at the surface (approximately 40 ± 10 °C).

* The 100 cm liquid pool burner is 15 cm deep with a wall thickness of 1.6 mm and has a lip height of 10 mm. It is also water cooled at the bottom (approximately 17 ± 3 °C).

* For convenience, all experimental data reported here use a cylindrical coordinate system with the **fuel surface as the z-axis origin** and the pool center as the r-axis origin.  _NOTE: In some instances the coordinate frame has been shifted from what was reported in the literature such that the origin is the fuel surface instead of the top of the burner rim._

#### Fuel Mass Flux

* The table at the top of the page shows the measured mass flux for all the pool fires averaged over the results reported by the references in the table.

* For example the measured mass flux for the 30 cm methanol pool fire, averaged over the various studies, is 13.2 ± 0.9 g/(m<sup>2</sup> s) (Kim et al., 2019; Buch et al. 1997; Klassen and Gore, 1994; Weckman and Strong, 1996; Hamins et al., 1994; Falkenstein-Smith et al., 2020a, 2020b).


#### Radiative Fraction

* The table at the top of the page shows the measured radiative fraction for the pool fires averaged over the results reported by the cited references.

* For example, the measured radiative fraction for the 30 cm methanol pool fire, averaged over the various studies, is 0.22 ± 0.02 based on the cited references (Kim et al., 2019; Buch et al., 1997; see discussion of Klassen and Gore's 1994 results in Sung et al., 2020).

* The measured radiative fraction for the 100 cm methanol pool fire is 0.21 ± 0.01 (Klassen and Gore, 1994; Sung et al., 2020). The radiative fraction measured by Klassen and Gore was recalculated using the net heat of combustion of 19940 kJ/kg and to improve the estimate of radiative heat feedback to the pool surface (see Sung et al., 2020).

#### Puffing Frequency

The dominant puffing frequencies was determined from analysis of large scale features of the plume (e.g., flame height).  See papers for more detail.

### Local Measurements

#### Coordinate System and Lip Height

* For convenience, all experimental data reported here use a cylindrical coordinate system with the **fuel surface as the z-axis origin** and the pool center as the r-axis origin.

* It should be noted that in many of the liquid pool fire references the results are reported using the burner rim (top of the lip) as the z-axis origin (Hamins et al., 1994; Klassen et al., 1994; Hamins and Lock, 2016; Kim et al., 2019). The lip height (distance from the top of the burner rim to the fuel surface) varied from study to study.

* For the 30 cm diameter methanol pool fires, Weckman and Strong (1996) and Kim et al. (2019) report a lip height of 10 mm, whereas Hamins et al. (1994), Klassen et al. (1994) and Hamins and Lock (2016) report a lip height of 5 mm.

#### Temperature

* The table at the top of the page shows the thermocouple bead diameter for each of the temperature data files.

* Temperature measurements were made using fine-wire, bare-wire, type S (platinum) thermocouples with approximately spherical beads. The table below lists the thermocouple bead diameters used to acquire the pool fire temperature data. The associated references are also listed.

* Hamins and Lock (2016) report mean and rms centerline and radial thermocouple temperature measurements in a 30 cm methanol pool fire. The radial measurements were made at heights of 3.8 and 30.8 cm above the pool surface (as opposed to the rim of the burner). Measurements were made with a nearly-spherical 225 µm diameter bare-bead, 75 µm wire diameter, type S thermocouple.

* Sung and Hamins (2021) report mean and rms radial thermocouple temperature measurements in a 30 cm methanol pool fire. Radial measurements were made at heights of 41, 51, and 61 cm above the pool surface (as opposed to the rim of the burner). Measurements were made with a nearly-spherical 150 µm diameter bare-bead, 50 µm wire diameter, type S thermocouple. Centerline measurements made with a nearly-spherical 52 µm diameter bare-bead, 13 µm wire diameter, type S thermocouple are available upon request.

* Sung et al. (2020) report mean and rms centerline and radial thermocouple temperature measurements in a 100 cm methanol pool fire. Radial measurements were made at heights of 21, 61, 101, 141, and 181 cm above the pool surface (as opposed to the rim of the burner). Measurements were made with a nearly-spherical 153 µm diameter bare-bead, 50 µm wire diameter, type S thermocouple.

#### Gas Species and Soot

* Falkenstein-Smith et al. (2020a and 2020b) measured the time-averaged centerline species concentrations within the flaming region of three 30 cm liquid fuel fires: acetone, ethanol, and methanol. Falkenstein-Smith et al. (2020b) measured the time-averaged centerline species concentrations and temperatures in a 34 kW methane fire and 20 kW and 34 kW propane fires established on a 37 cm diameter gas burner. The measurements were made using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer system (GC/MSD). The volume fraction of each species was calculated via the number of moles identified by the GC/MSD at each centerline point. Soot mass fractions were measured during the gas sampling process. The data for the liquid fuels is in the files `Acetone_30_cm.csv`, `Ethanol_30_cm.csv`, and `Methanol_30_cm.csv`. The data for the gaseous fuels is in `Methane_37_cm.csv`, `Propane_37_cm_20_kW.csv`, and `Propane_37_cm_34_kW.csv`.

* For the methanol, ethanol and acetone pool fires, the amount of CO in the exhaust stream was below detection limits, so the combustion efficiency is thought to be close to 1. (Kim et al., 2019; Sung et al, 2019)

#### Heat Flux

* Radiative and total heat flux measurements were made at various locations in the 30 cm and 100 cm methanol pool fires, mapping the heat flux emitted radially outward from the vertical surface and downwards through the bottom surface of a cylindical control volume about the fire.

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Hamins_1994.csv` Radial profile of radiative heat flux in the downward direction from the pool center (r = 0) towards the burner edge (r ≅ 15 cm). The positions of the heat flux gauges were z = 0.5 cm above the fuel surface and oriented in the upward direction. (Hamins et al., 1994)

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Klassen_1994.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux in the downward direction from the burner edge (r = 15 cm) to r = 85 cm. The positions of the heat flux gauges were z = 0.5 cm above the fuel surface and oriented in the upward direction. (Klassen and Gore, 1994)

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Kim_2019.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux in the downward direction from the pool center (r = 0) to r = 1.5 m.  The heat flux gauges were oriented in the upward direction and positioned z = 1.3 cm and z = 1.0 cm above the fuel surface for 0 ≤ r (cm) ≤ 15 and 15 ≤ r (cm) ≤ 150, respectively. (Kim et al., 2019)

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_vertical_Kim_2019.csv` Vertical profile of total heat flux emitted radially away from the fire acquired at various z heights above the fuel surface at r = 60 cm from the pool center and oriented towards the fire centerline. (Kim et al., 2019)

`Methanol_100_cm_HF_radial.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux in the downward direction from the burner edge (r = 0.50 m) to r = 2 m. The positions of the heat flux gauges were located z = 1 cm above the fuel surface and oriented in the upward direction. (Sung et al., 2019)

`Methanol_100_cm_HF_vertical.csv` Vertical profiles of total heat flux emitted radially away from the fire acquired at various z heights above the fuel surface and r distances from the pool center and oriented towards the fire centerline. (Sung et al., 2019)
