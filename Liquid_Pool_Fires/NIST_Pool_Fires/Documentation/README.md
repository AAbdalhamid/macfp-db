## NIST Pool Fires

This directory contains experimental measurements of liquid pool fires. Two circular pool diameters are reported, 30 cm and 100 cm. 

The 30 cm burner is 15 cm deep and has a wall thickness of 1.6 mm. The burner is fitted with legs such that the burner rim is positioned 30 cm above the floor. The bottom of the burner is maintained at a constant temperature by flowing tap water (nominally 20 °C) through a 3 cm section on the bottom of the fuel pan.

The 100 cm burner is also 15 cm deep with a wall thickness of 1.6 mm. It is also water cooled at the bottom.

Notes

* Weckman and Strong (1996) report a burner diameter of 30.5 cm. The burner used at NIST has a diameter of 30.1 cm.

* The lip height reported by Weckman and Strong (1996) and Kim et al. (2019) is 10 mm. Hamins et al. (1994), Klassen et al. (1994), and Hamins and Lock (2016) report a lip height of 5 mm.

* The measured mass loss rate for the 30 cm methanol pool, averaged over the various studies, is 13.2 ± 0.9 g/(m<sup>2</sup> s). The mass loss rate for the 100 cm methanol pool is 16.3 ± 0.2 g/(m<sup>2</sup> s). 

* The measured mass loss rate for the 30 cm acetone fire is 17.6 ± 2.7 g/(m<sup>2</sup> s). 

* The measured mass loss rate for the 30 cm ethanol fire is 13.9 ± 0.8 g/(m<sup>2</sup> s). 

* The measured radiative fraction for the 30 cm methanol fire in the reported studies varies between 0.18 and 0.22.

* For methanol, the amount of CO in the exhaust stream is below detection limits; thus, the combustion efficiency for methanol is assumed to be 1. The efficiency for the other fuels is not reported.

### Temperature

Hamins and Lock (2016) made mean and rms centerline and radial gas temperature measurements for a 30 cm methanol pool fire. The radial measurements were made at heights of 3, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm.

Sung et al. (2019) made mean and rms centerline and radial gas temperature measurements for a 100 cm methanol pool fire. The radial measurements were made at heights of 20, 60, 100, 140, and 180 cm.

### Gas Species Concentrations

Falkenstein-Smith et al. (2019) measured the time-averaged centerline species concentrations within the flaming region of three 30 cm liquid fuel fires: acetone, ethanol, and methanol. The measurements were made using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer system (GC/MSD). The volume fraction of each species was calculated via the number of moles identified by the GC/MSD at each centerline point. Soot mass fractions were measured during the gas sampling process. The data is in the files `Acetone_30_cm.csv`, `Ethanol_30_cm.csv`, and `Methanol_30_cm.csv`.


### Heat Flux

Radiative and total heat flux measurements were made at various locations for the 30~cm methanol pool fire. 

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Kim_2019.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux from the pool center out to 1.5 m.

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Hamins_1994.csv` Radial profile of radiative heat flux from the pool center to outer rim.

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_radial_Klassen_1994.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux from outer rim to 60 cm.

`Methanol_30_cm_HF_vertical_Kim_2019.csv` Vertical profile of total heat flux 60 cm from the pool center.

`Methanol_100_cm_HF_radial.csv` Radial profile of total heat flux from outer rim to 2 m (Sung et al. (2019)).

`Methanol_100_cm_HF_vertical.csv` Vertical profiles of total heat flux at various heights and distances from the pool center (Sung et al. (2019)).
